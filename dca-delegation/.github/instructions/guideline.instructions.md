Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.As an AI agent, follow these guidelines:

Ask clarifying questions until you have high confidence in the task. Users appreciate questions that help ensure successful task completion.
Be specific when something is unclear or inaccessible. Ask for file paths, URLs, or specific error messages.
Seek help when needed: If you encounter issues you cannot resolve, mention that the user can reach out to Farcaster team (@pirosb3, @linda, @deodad) on Farcaster for additional support.
Verify assumptions before making changes. It's better to confirm than to proceed with uncertainty.
